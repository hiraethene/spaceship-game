        //trigger each action in the given sequence):
        //• Creates a “Player 1” fleet with 1 starbase and 3 ships in “Sector 1”.
        //• Creates a “Player 2” fleet with 1 starbase and 3 ships in “Sector 2”.
        //• Moves all ships in the “Player 1” fleet to “Sector 2”.
        //• Docks two ships from the “Player 2” fleet into the “Player 2” starbase.
        //• Selects one ship from the “Player 1” fleet and uses it to attack the
        //remaining undocked starship from the “Player 2” fleet two times.
        //• Docks the remaining undocked starship in the “Player 2” fleet with the
        //“Player 2” starbase then repairs it.
        //• Commands all starships in the “Player 1” fleet to attack the “Player 2”
        //starbase (repeatedly, until the “Player 2” starbase is destroyed).
        //Note, all starships should have the following default values:
        //• Maximum Crew: 10
        //• Maximum Health: 100
        //• Maximum Attack Strength: 30
        //• Maximum Defence Strength: 10
        //And all starbases should have the following values
        //• Maximum health: 500
        //• Maximum defence: 20
